\section*{Welcome} \label{welcome}
If you are reading this, then you have traveled to
Karls\-ruhe, found the conference location and managed to
sign in. The complicated bits are behind you, and
you can relax. This booklet tells you everything about our planned
schedule for the two conference days and the hack day.

The central conference location with registration desk and
coffee breaks is on the ground floor of building B. Talks are
be held in the auditorium in building B (ground floor) and
the one in building A (1st floor, signposted ``Aula''). Consult 
the map on page 14 if you're unsure where to go.

Lightning talks will take place in the auditoriums, 
and we have rooms on
the 1st floor of building B for BoF sessions. There's also be a ``chill out
room'' where you can work on something quietly if you
want. If you want to hold a BoF or a lightning talk, please
add yourself on the appropriate flip charts that we will
place near the registration desk.

The registration desk is also your port of call if you need
support or help of any kind.

We would like to thank our sponsors, pictured on the back
of this booklet, without whom the conference would not
have been possible.

Thank you for coming, and we hope you'll enjoy your stay with us in Karlsruhe!
