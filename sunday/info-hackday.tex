\section*{Sunday -- Hack Day and Workshops}
\label{sunday}

We are changing the venue on Sunday, away from the green of
the campus to the somewhat smaller inner-city university
location in Amalienstra√üe. Here, 
four workshops of about
one hour each will take place during the day (starting at 10h,
11h, 14h, and 15h), and there will be ample room for
hacking on your favourite OSM project. If you are more of an
outdoor type, join the excursion to a nearby nature reserve
starting at 8:00!

Hot and cold beverages are provided. At lunch, 
grab a Kebab next door, go for pizza, or sit outside at
the vibrant Ludwigsplatz down the road (see map). There's also an ice cream parlour just outside the
building, or you could order pizza from Kai's (www.kais-pizza.de).
