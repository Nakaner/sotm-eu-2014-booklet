\section*{Sunday -- Hack Day and Workshops}

We are changing the venue on Sunday, away from the green of
the campus to the somewhat smaller inner-city university
location in Amalienstra√üe. Here, we have one auditorium and a
couple of classrooms at our disposal. Four workshops of about
one hour each will take place during the day (starting at 10:00,
11:00, 14:00, and 15:00), and there will be ample room for
hacking on your favourite OSM project.

Hot and cold beverages will be provided, but you're on your own
for lunch - grab a Kebab next door, go for pizza, or sit outside at
the vibrant Ludwigsplatz down the road (see map on opposite
page). There's also an ice cream parlour just outside the
building, or you could order pizza from Kai's (www.kais-pizza.de).
