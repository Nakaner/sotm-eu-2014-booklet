\abstractwithspeaker{09:30}{Building A}{João Porto de Albuquerque}{Identifying Elements at Flood Risk with Volunteered Geographic Information}%
{An Approach based on OpenStreetMap with a Case Study in Cologne}%
{João Porto de Albuquerque is visiting Professor at Heidelberg University and Professor at University of Sao Paulo, currently researching on Collaborative Systems and VGI for Disaster Risk Management. }%
{The identification of elements at risk is an essential part in Hazard Risk Assessment. Especially for recurring natural hazards like floods, an updated database with information about critical elements at flood risk (e.g. schools, hospitals etc.) is fundamental to support crisis preparedness and response activities. However, acquiring and maintaining an up-to-date database with elements at risk requires both detailed local knowledge and hazard-specific constraints, being often a challenge for local communities due to lack of expertise and appropriate funding, deferred priorities and complex political determinations.

This talk presents a new approach for leveraging OpenStreetMap to automatically identify hazard-specific elements at risk. We provide a new data model for extracting elements at risk from OSM and conduct a case study in the city of Cologne, Germany to validate our approach.}

{An Emergency Call. When Mappers Go United\dots}%
{Francesca Murtas is an interaction designer. Mapping is a state of mind.}%
{I would like to share and talk about my experience with the free map SardSOS that I've created while confronting with the devastating floods which damaged my island, Sardinia, in November 2013. I've built an open crowdmap on the Ushahidi platform (http://sardsos.crowdmap.com/) which has been visited by nearly 14,000 people in the first week.

This project has also triggered the release of open geo-data from the Sardinian government. It pushed the Italian mainstream media to talk about OSM and inspired other regions and public administrations towards opening their data and looking at OSM with interest.

I will also report about an independent online research, after the emergency, aimed at checking the use and the perception of people of OpenStreetMap and mapping for emergencies.}

\abstractwithspeaker{11:00}{Building B}{Roland Olbricht}{Sparse Editing}%
{Editing Large Scale Objects}%
{Roland has been a mapper since 2008. He started Overpass API in 2009 to make OSM data more accessible. He has a PhD in pure mathematics, a strong background in computer science, and a passion for high performance algorithms and transport networks. Currently he works as a computer scienst at Fraunhofer SCAI in Bonn. }%
{While OpenStreetMap has an impressive data quality on small scale objects, large scale objects are often only mapped in low quality. One example is the often discussed subject of mapping public transport services, and indeed these are far from complete or consistent.

The deeper reason for this is that editing large scale objects is exceptionally hard. The larger an object is, the more spatial dependencies it is involved in. For example, a public transport relation can be damaged by each and every roundabout or lane mapping attempt.

In this talk we will analyze which typical kinds of dependencies exist and discuss various approaches like route suggestion or mapping on a filtered subset of data. As a hands-on example it is shown how to efficiently recover a lost name tag on the river Rhine by editing an area of more than a hundred kilometers extent in JOSM.}

{Focussing on OSM and Comparing Against Routing with Professional Data}%
{Harald Koertge founded his first company developing navigation systems in 1997 for PalmOS devices. Since that time, he has developed and designed multiple generations of map data models, routing engines, etc. for commercial and OSM data.}%
{As OSM is gaining more traction for usage in navigation and routing for mobile devices and applications, it’s important to understand the differences between commercial map data and OSM data, particularly for effective route calculations. 

Following a brief history of routing engines that were primary developed for high performance usage on mobile devices, I will share what and where the challenges are in OSM versus commercial/professional data, from the perspective of having been entrenched in both worlds for many years.}

{Simon Legner has been a JOSM developer since 2011, an OSM mapper since 2008, and is a computer scientist.}%
{JOSM is a Java-based offline editor for OpenStreetMap which has been around since 2005. A recurring challenge for editors is validating user input, guiding mappers towards making as few mistakes as possible.

This talk will provide insights in the current development. Emphasis will be on the use of the MapCSS styling system for data validation, a technique which has been developed in recent months.}

{An OpenStreetMap Bobot}%
{Oliver Kaleske is a physicist, working in software development, and has been an OSM contributor since 2010.}%
{Wall·E is a maintenance robot I have been operating on OpenStreetMap in Germany since the end of 2012. The edits performed range from simple tasks such as the reduction of repeatedly referenced nodes in
ways to relatively sophisticated corrections in addr:* tags. Compared to other robots, Wall·E still has a relatively low total edit count (roughly 30k by early 2014), but this also
reflects the rather conservative editing strategy employed, which includes several precautions to avoid misfixes.

The talk will cover some of the technical aspects (filtering patterns, tools involved, safety measures) as well as the robot's history starting from xybot, an earlier OSM robot which served as
a model for many of Wall·E's functions, and some remarks on the role of robots within the social system of OSM.}

{Thomas Graichen studied information engineering at the Technische Universität Chemnitz. He is currently member of the scientific staff of the Chair for Circuit and System Design, interested in hiking, biking and therefore in OSM outdoor maps, too.}%
{Although the OSM community has built several indoor projects, an Android application for viewing indoor maps remains unavailable. As part of an electric mobility project, the group at TU Chemnitz has developed an application that fills this gap.

The concept and an overview of the chosen implementation shall be presented here. The talk will focus in particular on the usage of the mapsforge library, which is widely used for creating outdoor maps, and how it was applied to draw indoor maps. The indoor data itself is described using the scheme proposed by Marcus Goetz (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IndoorOSM).

Furthermore future developments and possible usage scenarios for this map application are presented.}

{A tool to add Wikipedia tags in OSM and coordinates in Wikipedia}%
{Cristian Consonni is researcher at the ``Digital Commons Lab'' unit of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), in Trento, Italy, Wikimedia Italia's vicepresident and Wikipedian, free software activist, physicist and storyteller.}%
{When you visit a Wikipedia article for a monument or a place (e.g. the Colosseum) you can find a link which will display the same object highlighted on OpenStreetMap: this tool is called WIWOSM and it was created by German mapper and Wikipedian Kolossos. It works using the ``Wikipedia'' tags, i.e. wikipedia=language:article, added by volunteers in OSM.

This presentation introduces a new tool called Wikipedia-tags-in-OSM (WTOSM) that makes easier to add the ``Wikipedia'' tags in OSM using JOSM ``remote control'' feature, and also allows adding coordinates in Wikipedia articles using the {{Coord}} template and OAuth authentication. This project is released as free software (GPLv3) on GitHub. We believe that it can help the OpenStreetMap community to discover new objects to map from Wikipedia pages and also it can create a bridge among the two projects.}

{We want to create a photo representation of the world, a map with photos of every place on Earth. Current street view alternatives have so many limitations from the fact that they are created using cars with camera rigs, focusing on streets. There are many places on this planet that they will never get to, and even the places they do get to will not get updated as often as you might want them to. Together we can fix that. 

Also, Mapillary wants to provide the image data to OSM for enhancing that data. 
Peter is going to talk about the technical and some of the legal aspects of the system and give some insights into the possible use cases and some existing (after just a few months) interesting usage.}

{Monitoring Consistency using Spatial Features and Tag Semantics}%
{Alfonso Crisci is native biometerologist/geostatistician going to OSM-ollywood with some crazy ideas.}%
{Monitoring consistency and reliability of maps is an important task when Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is involved and OpenStreetMap provides a good testing ground to develop operative methodologies that can be used as a web application. Two questions about data consistency are considered: for any given region (I) Is the level of spatial features density at a given scale enough for a suitable geographical description? (II) Is the semantics of the features (described by keys and tags) consistent and comprehensive?

This talk presents preliminary results from work done by Alfonso Crisci (IBIMET-CNR), Maurizio Napolitano (FBK-Trento), Francesca De Chiara (FBK-Trento), Valentina Grasso (IBIMET-CNR, LaMMA Consortium), and Cristian Consonni (FBK-Trento).}

{Geocoding Session}%
{It Sounds Easy but is it?}%
{}%
{Geocoding is the art of searching for places and looking up
the address of a location.
OSM has mostly used Nominatim in the last couple of years, which
allows world-wide search but relies on a one-size-fits all approach.
This session brings together three talks about new solutions to
adapt geocoding to local requirements.

\textit{Gary Gale} talks about the developing geocoding infrastructure for
OSM and how to bring it together. Gary has worked in the mapping
space for over 20 years. He's currently consulting with Lokku as
Geotechnologist in Residence.

\textit{Randy Meech} will introduce Pelias, a new geocoder focussed
on combining multiple data sources and providing an easily customizable
query parser. Randy is CEO of Mapzen, a company working on an open source
mobile mapping application.

\textit{Dmitry Kiselev} will talk about different address formats in different
countries and present OSM Gazetteer, a new geocoder focussed on
country-specific processing of OSM data. Dmitry is a keen GIS programmer
and has been involved in OSM since 2010.

{Using OpenStreetMap Data for Analysis}%
{Jerry Clough has been interested in maps since the age of four. He has a professional background in scientific research (Genetics, Computer Science) and business consultancy, and is an enthusiastic amateur naturalist. OSM forms a natural nexus between these diverse interests. }%
{Most uses of OSM data fall into three categories, the three ``R''s: Rendering (cartography), Routing, and 'Rummaging' (search, geolocation). However, the large and diverse sets of data within OSM also have considerable potential for answering analytical questions.

The patchiness of OSM data significantly hinders its use for analysis.  But there are other aspects of the data which don't help either. Examples of how OSM data can be used for analysis will be presented to demonstrate both the potential and the underlying issues.

Analysis places different demands on how data is mapped in OSM: a focus on using specific subsets of the data will highlight inconsistencies, and identify missing information. Making OSM data usable for analytics tests and stresses is in ways different from the typical uses. Therefore particular analysis problems can help enrich and extend how and what we map.}
