\section*{Saturday Evening}

We have reserved about 100 seats at the \textbf{Kühler Krug} brewery
and biergarten pictured below, for Saturday starting 19:00. At
2.5\,km from Europaplatz (and less than 2\,km from Hotel Rio) it is
still a walkable distance away but you can also take tram No 6
from Mathystraße (direction ``Daxlanden''---don't get confused if
other sources say that Kühler Krug is served by tram No 5, this is
a temporary change). See also the map on the opposite page, or
the marker on the folded conference map.
